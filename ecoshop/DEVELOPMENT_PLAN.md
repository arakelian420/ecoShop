3. Use feature branches for all development
4. Follow the established project structure

### Communication Protocol
1. Daily standup to discuss progress
2. Weekly code review sessions
3. Document all major decisions
4. Use project management tools for task tracking

### Git Workflow
1. Create feature branches from development
2. Use conventional commits
3. Require pull request reviews
4. Maintain clean commit history

### Code Review Process
1. Self-review before submitting PR
2. Peer review required
3. Automated tests must pass
4. Documentation must be updated

### Documentation Requirements

2. API documentation
3. Setup instructions
4. Deployment guide

## Two-Person Team Collaboration

### Component Ownership Documentation
1. **Required Component Headers**:
   ```tsx
   /**
    * @component [ServerComponent|ClientComponent]
    * @owner [Developer1|Developer2]
    * @status [WIP|REVIEW|STABLE|DEPRECATED]
    * @lastModified YYYY-MM-DD
    * @description Purpose of this component
    */
   ```

2. **Directory Ownership**:

   - `/app/(dashboard)/admin/**`: Developer 2
   - `/components/ui/**`: Shared (changes require notification)
   - `/components/features/cart/**`: Developer 1
   - `/components/features/products/**`: Developer 2

### Interface Contracts
1. **Shared Component Interfaces**:
   - Define TypeScript interfaces for props before implementation
   - Document all props with JSDoc comments
   - Create interface contract files in `/types/interfaces/`
   - No breaking changes without prior agreement

2. **API Contract Documentation**:
   - Document API endpoints in `/docs/api/`
   - Include request/response schemas
   - Version all API changes
   - Notify other developer of changes

### Shared Code Protocols
1. **Notification Required**:
   - Before modifying any shared utility
   - When updating UI component library
   - When changing TypeScript interfaces
   - When modifying API endpoints

2. **Handoff Process**:
   - Document feature completion in PR
   - Provide brief demo/walkthrough to other developer
   - Include test cases and usage examples
   - Update relevant documentation

### Conflict Resolution
1. **Code Conflicts**:
   - Meet to resolve git conflicts together
   - Respect ownership boundaries when merging
   - Maintain consistent code style
   - Document resolution decisions

2. **Design Conflicts**:
   - Use design system as source of truth
   - Prioritize consistency over individual preferences
   - Escalate to team lead when needed

   - Review AI-generated code before committing

2. **AI Attribution**:
   - Add `[AI-assisted]` tag to commit messages for significant AI contributions
   - Include `/* AI-generated */` comment block above AI-generated functions
   - Document AI decisions in technical design documents

3. **Model Context Boundaries**:
   - Provide complete context when requesting AI modifications
   - Include imports, component structure, and dependencies
   - Share AI-generated code with team before implementation

4. **Consistent AI Interaction**:
   - Use similar prompting styles for consistency
   - Share effective prompts between team members
   - Document prompt patterns that work well

### Shared AI Resources
1. **Prompt Library**:
   - Maintain shared prompt library for common tasks
   - Include sample inputs and outputs

   - Document expected behaviors at boundaries

2. **Integration Testing Ownership**:
   - Developer who owns primary feature leads integration tests
   - Secondary developer reviews integration tests
   - Both participate in fixing integration issues

3. **End-to-End Test Scenarios**:
